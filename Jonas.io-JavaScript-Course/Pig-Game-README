This is the very first project in the course. It is about 20% of the way in.
The Pig Game HTML document and StyleSheet for this project were created by the instructor of the course, Jonas.
I followed along with the video to create the JavaScript code that makes it work.
My script does not exactly match the script from the video. I think Jonas had plagarism in mind when creating the course.
The script from the video and course files only work for one round of the game, then it breaks. I fixed it on my own.
I also went back and added some looping background music to the HTML and changed the style to my liking in the StyleSheet.
This was my first time linking JavaScript to an HTML document and manipulating the DOM instead of just learning about it.
Up until this project, I had no experience implementing JavaScript; only writing and reading it.
I learned some new things and gained some confidence in my abilities. Hopefully I can keep this momentum going.
I plan to make future changes to practice any new tricks I am intrested in.
